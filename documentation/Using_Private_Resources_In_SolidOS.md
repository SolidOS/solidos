# Using Private Resources in SolidOS

## Short Answer

In SolidOS, always use `solid-ui.authn.currentUser()` to check if the user has a webID; do not directly check
`authSession.info.webId` **except during operations on the `authSession` itself**.

* use `me = authn.currentUser()` in places not directly part of `authSession` management
* use `me = authn.authSession.info.webId` during `authSession` operations such as `box.refresh` and other login functions
* use `await authn.checkUser()` when you need to activate a session after login
* check URLs like `http//foo/?uri=http://bar` or web app and Dk will not function

The basic idea is that `currentUser()` is for answering the question, "should this user have access to this resource?",
while `checkUser` and `session.info.webId` are for answering the question, "is this user logged in?"  These are the same
thing on a normal server, but they are two different things when dealing with apps similar to Data-Kitchen, which need
to differentiate between _having access to the local server without being logged in_ and _needing to login to access
private respources on remote pods_.

## Longer answer

We want the SolidOS experience of private resources, like local file systems and cloud storages, to be the same as for
Pods, except that the user is treated as already logged-in for the private resources, assuming that they have their own
authentication system outside of Solid.

An app — a deployment of `mashlib/dist/browse.html` — can mark itself as serving private resources that do not need Solid
authentication. For example, a desktop app might serve local files, or proxy to Dropbox files, like so:
```
  window.SolidAppContext = {
    noAuth : 'http://localhost:3000/',
    webId : 'http://localhost:3000/localUser/profile/card#me',
  }
```
That says, "when viewing pages on this private site, don't try to login or authenticate; use the webId I have supplied
instead, and treat me as always logged in to this site".  If the private site has profiles, preferences, etc., SolidOS
can now serve them as they would to an authenticated page using that webId; for example, displaying a dashboard.

From the point of view of SolidOS, this means that we should not directly use `solid-ui.authn.authSession.webId` as a way
to treat the user as logged in. Instead, we should use the `solid-ui.authn.currentUser()` method, which now does a check
for the `window.SolidAppContext`. Instead of checking for "is authenticated", this will check for "is logged in", which
includes authenticated access to non-private sites AND unauthenticated access to a private site.

Here's how the `currentUser` method (or technically, the `appContext` method it calls) knows which pages to authenticate:
If the user has specified a site as `noAuth`, and the current `location.href` hostname is that site, and the `uri`
parameter of the `location.href` is also on that site, treat it as a `noAuth` request.  So if the databrowser is being
served from a private site AND the databrowser is viewing a page on that private site, don't require authentication
check or login. However, if the databrowser is served from the private site and viewing a page on any other site, _do_
require an authentication check and possible login.  This point is relevant everywhere, not just login — if you are
using a URL, check to see if it is viewing one page from another page, and do the action on the page being viewed.

The worst that happens if someone tries to spoof things is that the UI lies about the user being logged in, and when
they try to access something that requires Solid authentication, they'll get a `401 Unauthorized` response.
